# PowerBI-and-Netflix-Data
The purpose of this dataset is to test my data visualization skills with PowerBI.

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies and TV shows. 
This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
